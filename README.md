A website to track the climbing projects I am working on. 
Let's you add different gyms and dictate which grading scheme they use at their respective gyms
Let's you mark off when you have started the route and then edit it later when you have completed it
Each route has a gym attached to it and each gym can have many different routes
Allows for deletion of routes and gyms when needed
